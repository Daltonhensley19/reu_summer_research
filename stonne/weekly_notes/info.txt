Course-grained: treat all lines identically when they are inserted into the
cache and only dierentiate among lines based on their their behavior while they
reside in the cache. For example, as a line resides in the cache, its priority
might be increased each time it is reused.

By contrast, Fine-Grained policies distinguish among lines when they are
inserted into the cache (in addition to observing their behavior while they
reside in the cache). To make this distinction at the time of insertion,
Fine-Grained policies typically rely on historical information about cache
access behavior.

Granularity: At what granularity are lines distinguished at the time of
insertion? Are all cache lines treated the same, or are they assigned dierent
priorities based on historical information?

â€¢ History: How much historical information does the replacement policy utilize
in making its decisions?

Access Patterns: How specialized is the replacement policy to certain access
patterns? Is it robust to changes in access patterns or to mixes of dierent
access Patterns
